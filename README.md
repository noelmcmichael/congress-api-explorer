# Congress API Explorer with MCP Integration

## Project Overview

This project explores the US Congress API (api.congress.gov) using Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, focusing on committee hearings tracking and analysis. The primary goal is to create an intelligent congressional data access system that integrates with Memex as an MCP client.

### Key Components

1. **Congress API Client**: Handles API requests with rate limiting (5000/day limit)
2. **Smart Caching**: Multi-layer caching with different TTLs:
   - Committee data: 24 hours
   - Hearing schedules: 6 hours
   - Bill status: 2 hours
   - Member info: 7 days
3. **MCP Server**: Implements protocol for AI tool integration
4. **Committee Focus**: Prioritizes hearing data and committee information

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Data Models**: Pydantic for type safety
- **API Client**: Async HTTP with retry logic
- **MCP**: Official Python SDK
- **Caching**: Redis-compatible (configurable)
- **Development**: Git version control, comprehensive testing

- [ ] Hearing tracking capabilities
- [ ] Witness and document access
- [ ] Related bill connections

### ðŸ“‹ Step 6: Integration Testing (Planned)
- [ ] MCP client testing
- [ ] API integration tests
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Rate limit validation

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `CONGRESS_API_KEY`: API key for Congress API access
- `CACHE_TYPE`: Caching backend (redis/memory)
- `CACHE_TTL`: Default cache time-to-live
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity

## API Rate Limits

- **Congress API**: 5000 requests/hour, 250 max results per request
- **Strategy**: Smart caching and request prioritization
- **Monitoring**: Track usage to stay well under limits

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set API Key**:
   ```bash
   export CONGRESS_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Run MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_mcp_server.py
   ```

4. **Test API Client**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_api_client.py
   ```
